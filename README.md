#  Deep Learning Applications — Project Overview

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Applications (DLA)** repository!  
This project contains three labs focused on exploring real-world applications of Deep Learning, including classification, reinforcement learning, transformers, and more.

Each lab is structured in subfolders with self-contained exercises, `README.md` files, and code. Below is a guide to help you quickly navigate through the project structure.

##  Labs Overview

###  [`Lab 1/`](./Lab%201) — Deep Learning Foundations
Build core intuition for deep architectures by training and comparing classic MLPs, CNNs, and residual models.

**Highlights**:
- `1.1`: Baseline MLP on MNIST  
- `1.2`: Adding Residual Connections to MLP  
- `1.3`: CNN vs. ResNet on CIFAR-10  
- `2.2`: Knowledge Distillation — transfer learning from large to small models

>  Focus: architecture comparison, performance tracking, reusability

###  [`Lab 2/`](./Lab%202) — Deep Reinforcement Learning
Apply and improve REINFORCE on CartPole and train agents on CarRacing using DQN or PPO.

**Highlights**:
- `2.1`: Improve REINFORCE evaluation with episodic metrics  
- `2.2`: Add a value network as baseline to stabilize policy gradients  
- `3.3`: Train a CNN-based agent to solve CarRacing using PPO or Deep Q-Learning

>  Focus: policy gradient stability, baseline learning, discrete-action RL

###  [`Lab 3/`](././Lab%203) — Transformers
Work with HuggingFace’s ecosystem to adapt transformer models for NLP and vision tasks.

**Highlights**:
- `1-2`: Sentiment analysis using DistilBERT — feature extraction and fine-tuning  
- `3.2`: Zero-shot classification and fine-tuning CLIP on vision tasks

>  Focus: tokenizer handling, sequence classification, parameter-efficient fine-tuning
